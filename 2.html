<p>
We are runnin' so fast
<br>And we never look back
<br>And whatever I lack, you make up
</p>

<p>
We make a really good team
<br>And not everyone sees
<br>We got this crazy chemistry
<br>Between us
</p>

<p>
Jump starting your car 'cause this city's a bore
<br>Buying e-cigarettes at the convenience store
<br>Making new clich√©s on our own little tour
<br>Let's ride
</p>

<p>
You don't have to say I love you to say I love you
<br>Forget all the shooting stars and all the silver moons
<br>We've been making shades of purple out of red and blue
<br>Sickeningly sweet like honey, don't need money
<br>All I need is you
<br>All I need is you, you
</p>
