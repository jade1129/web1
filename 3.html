<p> 
You ran away to find something to say
<br>I went astray to make it okay
<br>And he made it easy, darlin'
</p>

<p>
I'm still in love, and I say that because
<br>I know how it seems between you and me
<br>It hasn't been easy, darlin'
</p>

<p>
I can't even look at you
<br>Would you look at the space just next to your feet?
<br>The wood is warping
<br>The lines distorting
</p>

<p>
This house is on fire, woo!
<br>Burning the tears right off my face
<br>What the hell did we do?
<br>Tell me we'll make it through
<p>
